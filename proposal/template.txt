:writing_hand: Step 3: Crafting a Winning Proposal
Structure all your bids like this:
Hook (first three sentences) → Demonstrate your understanding of the goal.
Example: "You want an AI system on WhatsApp that responds instantly, handles high volumes of messages, and feels human. I've built similar chatbots and can provide a production-ready solution tailored to your needs."
Proof of Experience → Select only the most relevant skills.
Example: "We recently integrated the WhatsApp Business API with an OpenAI-based model to automate customer support, reducing manual effort by 60%."
Timeline → Be realistic.
Small bots → 1-2 weeks
Full-fledged platforms → 3-4 weeks
What you need to get started → Demonstrate your readiness.
Example: "All you need is API access and your preferred flow (knowledge base, FAQ, or custom logic)."
Conclude confidently →
Example: "I'm confident I can deliver exactly what you want. Let's discuss your goals and start building the system."
